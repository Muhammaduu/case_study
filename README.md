this simple machine learning project for predicting weather using AdaBoost Classifier
it contains six variables that is date, precipitation, temp_max,	temp_min,	wind and 	weather
with this date;
one may do projects such regression to predict temperature or precipitation
times series analysis to forecast weather.
